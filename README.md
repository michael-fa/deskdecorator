Install:
Put the executable file anywhere you want Note that you need to run this as administrator, when doing so.
Everything else will be loaded / initialised automatically.

⚠️ Note that putting (installing) the program (and it's folders) / extracting it somewhere in a Windows-System Related folder like _``Program Files``_, and _``Program Files (x86)``_
it will cause the Administrator Safety-thingy prompt from Windows to pop up before the program is started, meaning in some cases (autostart) to a failed program starrt. Simply installing it anywhere else, like in _``C:\Users\YourName\``_ will work completely fine.
I'll see what I can do for the next update, to fix this completely.

# How to display the current time like ' 22:33:13 ' on my Desktop?

You can create a label -> insert {time1} or {time2} in the text field in the creation window.
And check "dynamic" box!
